# This is the speedy resumable thingy

The file have not been compile yet this is just the source code you need
to compile first before using these file. 

How to use compile the source using javac in the future I will write a bash script so that you
can run ./srget.sh -o <output> -c <number of connection> <url>
 
 Right now to test the program you have to write java interfaceDL -o <output> <url link>
 can only run the program within out/production directory except if you rebuild and recompile into
 another directory from the Source code (you can use javac) for that
 
 Note: for people using IntelliJ just source to current working directory and IntelliJ you can write the compile
 and run the program without any problem or technical difficulties
 
The script is updated you can now run the script srget therefore you can call
srget -o <Filename> <http://www.hamuel.com> YEH!! nice binary source in "Out"
